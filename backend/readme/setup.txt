1. API Design:
- POST /products: Accepts product data with the following fields:
- `user_id` (reference to the user table).
- `product_name` (string).
- `product_description` (text).
- `product_images` (array of image URLs).
- `product_price` (decimal).
- GET /products/:id: Retrieves product details by ID, with image processing results.
- GET /products: Returns all products for a specific `user_id`, with optional filtering by
price range and product name.

2. Data Storage:
- Use PostgreSQL for storing `users` and `products` data. Design schema similar to
the example, with the following additional fields:
- Products Table: Add a `compressed_product_images` column for storing
processed images.

3. Asynchronous Image Processing:
- After storing product details, add the `product_images` URLs to a message queue
(RabbitMQ or Kafka).
- Create an image processing microservice that consumes messages from the queue,
downloads, compresses images, and stores compressed images in designated storage
(e.g., S3). Update the `compressed_product_images` field in the database upon
completion.

4. Caching:
- Use Redis to cache product data retrieved by the `GET /products/:id` endpoint to
reduce database load.
- Implement cache invalidation to ensure that updates to the product data are reflected
in real time.

5. Enhanced Logging:
- Implement structured logging (using a library like `logrus` or `zap`) for all service
components.
- Log all requests with response times, API errors, and processing details. Additionally,
log specific events in the image processing service (e.g., download success,
compression failure).

6. Error Handling:
- Implement robust error handling across all components, especially for asynchronous
processing failures (e.g., queue retry mechanisms or dead-letter queues).

7. Testing:
- Write unit tests for each API endpoint and core function.
- Include integration tests to validate end-to-end functionality, particularly
asynchronous processing and cache effectiveness.
- Benchmark tests for the `GET /products/:id` endpoint, measuring response times with
and without cache hits.
